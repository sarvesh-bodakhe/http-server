        <p>A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client
            requests on the
            World Wide Web. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming
            network
            requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.

            The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.[1] The
            communication between
            client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most
            frequently HTML
            documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
